This app depends on Handlebars, Mithril and lw-model.

Mithril is a framework very similar to React, but much more lightweight. It also uses the JSX syntax.

lw-model is a lightweight Backbone model with extended functionality.

The building process uses Gulp and Browserify.
```
npm run build
```

To test the app, run /dev/index.html in the browser.
